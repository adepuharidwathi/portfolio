        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hard-working, creative and proactive.I am thrilled to introduce myself as a passionate and motivated 
            with a strong foundation in Python, Java, C, and HTML&CSS. As a recent graduate in computer science,
            I have honed my programming skills and developed a keen interest in creating innovative solutions using 
            these versatile technologies.
            C has taught me the importance of low-level programming and memory management. Working with C has allowed
            me to understand the inner workings of computers and has contributed to my ability to optimize code for performance.
            Java has been another significant part of my learning experience, and I am fascinated by its object-oriented paradigm. 
            I have implemented several applications and gained insights into building robust and scalable software with Java. 
            Its "write once, run anywhere" capability intrigues me, as it enables us to cater to diverse platforms effortlessly.
            Alongside these programming skills, I have also dabbled in HTML, which forms the backbone of web development.
             Understanding HTML's structure has allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.

            <h3>SMART BOREWELL</h3>
            
            <p>
                A smart bore well provided with a lid  comprises an ultrasonic sensor , 
                an arduino board , a servo motor , a buzzer when an obstacle is detected then gets on,
                lcd screen to display the distance ,a battery module and custom controlled software application . 
                The ultrasonic sensor  measures the distance using ultrasonic sound waves. 
                The arduino board  provided to receive signals from sensor  and operate the servo motor  in closing the lid. 
                The servo motors  are used for precise control of angular position, velocity and acceleration. 
                The complete operation is controlled by custom controlled software application . 
                The ultrasonic sensor alerts the arduino by detecting the approaching to operate the servo motor
                 in closing of lid and buzzer gets on and then it displays the distance on lcd screen. 
                The battery is connected to the arduino and sensor for power supply.
